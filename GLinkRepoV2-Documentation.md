<h1>GLinkRepoV2 Documentation</h1>


<p>GLinkRepoV2 is a modern shortcut repository format used in GLink 1.2 and up and Equestria. This repo format is in json to make it easy to understand & write. It is very similar to eaic/easrng’s papercuts format, especially how Packages are stored. As an example of a repository in GLinkRepoV2, here’s the Papercuts for GLink repo:</p>

<p>{"Name":"Papercuts","Image","BASE64 IMAGE HERE","Maintainer":"eaic","Packages":"https://easrng.github.io/papercuts-repo/packages.json","Repository Format":"GLinkRepoV2"} Here’s an explanation of all the keys:</p>

<p>Name - The name of the repository</p>
<p>Image - Your base64 encoded image of your repository</p>
<p>Maintainer - The maintainer of your repository</p>
<p>Packages - Where your packages.json is stored (we'll touch more on this later)</p>
<p>Repository Format - The repository format of your repo.</p>

<p>This is the data of your repository, which is helpful for distinguishing multiple repositories from each other. Now, lets move on to packages.json.</p>

<h2>Packages.json</h2>
